    CONSOLE APPLICATION: ClientPatcher Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this ClientPatcher application for you.

This file contains a summary of the contents of each of the files that make up your ClientPatcher application.


ClientPatcher.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. It contains information about the version of Visual C++ used to generate the file, as well as information about the project's platforms, configurations and features that you selected in the Application Wizard.

ClientPatcher.vcxproj.filters
    This is the filter file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. It contains information about the association between your project files and filters. This association is used in the IDE to display the grouping of files that have similar extensions under a specific node (for example, ".cpp" files are associated with the "Source Files" filter).

ClientPatcher.cpp
    This is the main source file for the application.
