DD = Day (in two values, i.e 02)
MM = Month (in two values, i.e 10)
YY = Year (in two values, i.e 21)
VV = Volume (in two values, i.e 01)

Volume - If we have more than one SQL Fix in one single day, we have to give this an unique ID, we genuinly never pick a random two valued number.
But an increasing number from its predecessor. I.E if highest SQL of the day is Version 08, then this will be named 09.

Ask if this format is missunderstanding.
